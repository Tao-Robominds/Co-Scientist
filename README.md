Given a scientist’s research goal that has been specified in natural language, the AI co-scientist is designed to generate novel research hypotheses, a detailed research overview, and experimental protocols. To do so, it uses a coalition of specialized agents — Generation, Reflection, Ranking, Evolution, Proximity and Meta-review — that are inspired by the scientific method itself. These agents use automated feedback to iteratively generate, evaluate, and refine hypotheses, resulting in a self-improving cycle of increasingly high-quality and novel outputs.

The AI co-scientist parses the assigned goal into a research plan configuration, managed by a Supervisor agent. The Supervisor agent assigns the specialized agents to the worker queue and allocates resources. This design enables the system to flexibly scale compute and to iteratively improve its scientific reasoning towards the specified research goal.
